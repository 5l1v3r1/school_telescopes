Have expcontrol do more useful stuff with the info from sysconfig.json

Add "save profile" and "safe profile to system startup" buttons to
    expcontrol
    
Add a "re-run profile" section to the expcontrol page.

Arrange for airspy_web to start at system startup--maybe it should
  handle experimental startup-on-boot.  Yeah.  That's the ticket.
  
Try to reorganize expcontrol so that it's less cluttered and
  easier to understand.
  
Perhaps remove the timed-start/stop stuff for now.

Doing something with the experimental notes.
